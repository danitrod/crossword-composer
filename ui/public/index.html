        <strong>How to use:</strong> click squares in the grid above to toggle between filled and
        blank squares. Then, hit “Start” to start the filler. If the filler is slow, it is having
        trouble finding a combination of words that works with the pattern you provided. You can
        either give it time (but keep in mind not all grids have a solution!), or add more filled-in
        squares to make its job easier.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can leave the filler turned on as you modify the grid to see updates as quickly as the
        filler can operate. Just keep in mind that filling a crossword can be computationally
        intensive, so if you are on battery it's better not to leave it running as you edit.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to save a screenshot of the grid <em>without</em> the solutions, you can do so
        by ticking the “Hide Letters” box above before taking the screenshot.

        Crossword Composer was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgb">Paul Butler</a> using
        <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>,
        <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, and
        <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>. The vocabulary was taken from
        <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard">Tensorboard</a> and represents ~71k
        terms (including proper nouns, slang, abbreviations, etc.) from an English(ish) web corpus.
